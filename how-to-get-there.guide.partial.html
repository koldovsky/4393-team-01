                Stick to the US Route 120 or 140, or to the US 41 if you travel from the South. When in Yosemite Park,
                turn left and drive about 15 minutes, then turn right on the crossroad, and youâ€™ll see the Yosemite
                Village sign in 10 minutes.

                Buy a San Joaquins train ticket if you travel from San Francisco or Sacramento, and then change to the
                YARTS bus to get to the very Yosemite village, turn right from the bus stop and walk around 5 minutes.
